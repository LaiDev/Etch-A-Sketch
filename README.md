# Etch-A-Sketch: 8Bit - Sketch

This is my Etch A Sketch game completed in correlation with the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch).

It is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Create your own 8 bit Art!

**Your only limit is your imagination**
